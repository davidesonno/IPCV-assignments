model on `GroceryStoreDataset`. Use the implementation provided by PyTorch, do not implement it yourselves! (i.e. exactly what you **could not** do in the first part of the assignment). Specifically, you must use the PyTorch ResNet-18 model pretrained on ImageNet-1K (V1). Divide your fine-tuning into two parts:\n","\n","1. First, fine-tune the Resnet-18 with the same training hyperparameters you used for your best model in the first part of the assignment.\n","1. Then, tweak the training hyperparameters in order to increase the accuracy on the validation split of `GroceryStoreDataset`. Justify your choices by analyzing the training plots and/or citing sources that guided you in your decisions (papers, blog posts, YouTube videos, or whatever else you find enlightening). You should consider yourselves satisfied once you obtain a classification accuracy on the **validation** split **between 80 and 90%**."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"gpuType":"T4","provenance":[],"toc_visible":true},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.7"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
