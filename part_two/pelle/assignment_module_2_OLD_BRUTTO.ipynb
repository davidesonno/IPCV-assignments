Design choices include network architecture, training hyperparameters, and, possibly, dataset preprocessing steps. You can either (i) start from the simplest convolutional network you can think of and add complexity one step at a time, while showing how each step gets you closer to the target ~60%, or (ii) start from a model that is already able to achieve the desired accuracy and show how, by removing some of its components, its performance drops (i.e. an *ablation study*). You can *show* your results/improvements however you want: training plots, console-printed values or tables, or whatever else your heart desires: the clearer, the better.\n","\n","Don't be too concerned with your network performance: the ~60% is just to give you an idea of when to stop.
